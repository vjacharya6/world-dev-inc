# Demonstrating Data Science Tools

This exercise demonstrates basic features of several essential tools in data science:

- **SQL**
- **Pandas**
- **Regression Methods**
- **Pipelines and Composite Estimators**
- **Matplotlib**

## Focus Areas

The focus of this exercise includes:

- **Data Retrieval, Imputation, and Visualization**: Using various tools to retrieve data, compare different ways to handle missing values, and visualize the data.
- **Manipulating DataFrames in Pandas**: Performing operations and transformations on data using Pandas.
- **Preprocessing Data for Machine Learning Algorithms**: Preparing data for use in machine learning models.
- **Comparing Training, Validation, and Test Accuracy**: Evaluating the performance of basic regression algorithms in Sklearn.
- **Identifying key predictors**: Find the best predictors of maternal and child mortality.
- 
## Data Source

The data used in this exercise is from the World Bank's Health, Population, and Nutrition datasets, which can be accessed from Google's BigQuery data warehouse. More processed versions are also available on platforms like Kaggle and elsewhere. Here I work with the raw data. 

## Tools and Libraries

The following tools and libraries will be used in this exercise:

- **SQL**: For data retrieval.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-Learn (Sklearn)**: For implementing regression methods.
